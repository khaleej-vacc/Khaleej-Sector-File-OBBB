;*** 17 Pilot Info ***
.busy .msg $aircraft Hello. I am currently too busy to help you or to answer your question. Please refer to the manuals on www.vatsim.net/pilots or to www.vacc.ch or try to find another person who can help you.
.cr .msg $aircraft Please make a correct readback so that I see that you've understood my instructions correctly. A readback is made by repeating the instructions of the controller. 
.po .msg $aircraft Hello, the position you are standing is already occupied by another aircraft. Please choose another one, thank you!
.fpr .msg $aircraft Hello. Your filed route is subject to restrictions you do not comply with currently. Find validated routes at vats.im/bhrm.
.sc .msg $aircraft Hello. It seems you are using an inappropriate scenery for $uc($1) resulting in an offset to other pilots. For better experience, consider using one of the freeware sceneries listed on our website bahrainvacc.com.
.rp .msg $aircraft Startup does NOT include pushback. This first movement needs a separate clearance. Always request pushback, please. Thank you!
.cf .msg $aircraft The facing indicates the direction your nose should point to after the pushback is completed.
.ica .msg $aircraft A kind reminder: please comply with the initial altitude you were given within your clearance. This may have been included with the SID you were given.
.tatl .msg $aircraft Hello, the transition altitude within the Doha FIR is 13,000ft and the transition level is FL150. When flying at/or below the transition altitude you must set the LOCAL QNH which is given to you by the controller or the ATIS and refer to all altitudes in thousands of FEET. When flying at/or above the transition level you must set STANDARD PRESSURE (1013.25 hPa) on your altimeter. These levels are referred to as FLIGHT LEVELS. Thank you Captain!
.exg .msg $aircraft Hello, expect Gate $1, Happy Landing!
.exs .msg $aircraft Hello, expect Stand $1, Happy Landing!
.xp .msg $aircraft It seems you are using XPlane with inappropriate graphic settings. Your computer is not able to render the requested number of frames in time thus slowing down your simulator. Please adjust your graphic settings to increase the frame rate.
